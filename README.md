# JAH_Graph
This is my first attempt at implementing a Graph data structure and algorithms in Java. I wrote these as part of an experiment for a class project, but I hope to return to it and improve this implementation in the future. It appears to work fine for small graphs, but for graphs with thousands of nodes it becomes very slow and also performs some computations incorrectly. So when I get the chance I want to try and improve the efficiency and correctness of this implementation.

Stack.java and Queue.java were not written by me and were taken from https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/code/. All credit goes to the original authors.
